# pokemon
In this project, I analyze a dataset of Pokemon using R.
The external libraries used are rpart, rpart.plot, and ROCR.

This study is an exercise to show how to use foundations of Data Science in order to import, study, visualize, and present the raw data in a method that is easy for any user to digest and understand.

First, the csv dateset will be loaded into a dataframe.

Second, a logistic regression is built to determine the likelihood that a Pokemon is legendary, followed by a challenger decision tree model. The result from the decision tree model is visualized, so is the comparison of the two models.

Third, the models will be analyzed, yielding the accurate probability of a Pokemon being legendary.
